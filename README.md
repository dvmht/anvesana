# Anve·π£a·πáƒÅ üê¢

>**_/…ôn ãeÀê Ç…ô…≥…ëÀê/ ¬∑ Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§∑‡§£‡§æ_**  
search after, seek for, or inquiry into.  

Derived from the root verb "anve·π£" (‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§µ‡•á‡§∑), which means "to search for" or "to seek out".  
In the context of Vedic texts, Anve·π£a·πáƒÅ refers to the process of searching for
knowledge, wisdom, and understanding within these ancient scriptures.

Anvesana is tool that allows you to search through Vedic texts using natural language queries, using retrieval-augmented-generation to provide accurate and relevant answers.  
It is designed to help you find information quickly and efficiently, making it easier to explore the vast knowledge contained within Vedic literature.


## Available Texts
The following texts are currently supported:
- **Charaka Samhita**: A foundational text of Ayurveda, detailing various aspects of medicine, including diagnosis, treatment, and pharmacology. [1]

More texts coming soon.

## Usage
You can use Anvesana to ask questions about the texts.  
The Anvesana demo app is available [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dvmht/anvesana).  
You can also run Anvesana locally using Docker.

### Local Setup
Anvesana uses a local database to store the text data and requires a Google AI Studio API key to function (free tier). This needs to be set up once before running the app.  
1. Set the text source API URL in the `API_URL` environment variable.
   ```bash
    export API_URL=https://www.carakasamhitaonline.com/api.php
    ```

2. Run the following command to set up the database:
   ```bash
   python data/main.py
   ```
   This will create a SQLite database file `./data/` directory.


3. Set the Google AI Studio API key in the `GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY` environment variable.
   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```


### Example Queries
Unsure what to ask? Why not start with:
- What is Ayurveda?
- What is the difference between Ayurveda and modern medicine?
- How does Ayurveda define health?
- What are the principles of Ayurveda?
